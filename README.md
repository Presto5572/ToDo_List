# ToDo_List

Summary of Concepts Learned from the To-Do List Project
This project helped you build a To-Do List Manager with increasing complexity, covering key programming concepts in Python, SQL, and GUI development. Here's a summary of the key topics covered:

1. Python Fundamentals & Data Structures
Functions & Methods â€“ Defined reusable functions for task management.
Lists & Tuples â€“ Stored and manipulated tasks efficiently.
Exception Handling (try-except) â€“ Managed user input errors and database operations gracefully.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes & Objects â€“ Created a ToDoList class to encapsulate task-related functions.
Instance Methods & Attributes â€“ Stored tasks within a class and updated dynamically.
Encapsulation â€“ Used self to maintain class data integrity.

3. File Handling & Persistence
JSON Storage â€“ Initially saved tasks using json.dump() and loaded them using json.load().
SQLite Database Integration â€“ Migrated data storage to an SQL database.

4. SQL & Database Management
Creating and Managing Tables â€“ Designed a tasks table using SQL.
CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) â€“
INSERT INTO â€“ Adding tasks to the database.
SELECT * FROM â€“ Retrieving all tasks.
DELETE FROM â€“ Removing tasks by id.
Using Cursors & Connections â€“ Interacted with SQLite databases efficiently.
Tuple Usage in SQL Queries â€“ Prevented SQL errors (DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = ? needed a tuple: (task_id,)).

5. GUI Development with Tkinter
Tkinter Basics â€“ Created a graphical interface for task management.
Widgets â€“ Used labels, buttons, and listboxes to display tasks.
Event Handling â€“ Linked button clicks to class methods.
This project helped you solidify Python fundamentals, introduce OOP principles, and transition into SQL database management and GUI programming. Now, youâ€™re ready to pivot towards Python for Data Analytics while keeping these skills in your toolkit!

GitHub README for Your Project
Hereâ€™s a README file for your GitHub repository:

To-Do List Manager
A simple task management application that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks using Python, SQLite, and Tkinter.

Features:

âœ… Add new tasks with categories and due dates

âœ… View all tasks stored in a SQLite database

âœ… Remove tasks by selecting their unique ID

âœ… User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter

Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ Implement task priorities
ðŸ”¹ Add recurring tasks
ðŸ”¹ Use notifications/reminders
